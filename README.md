# Durango FTP

This is an FTP server app built for the Xbox One but compatible with other uwp devices aimed at providing the highest level of access possible.
It is based on the FTP Server library on https://github.com/ZhaobangChina/FtpServer

retail: https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/retroarch/9n1hpz6x31d5?rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab

```To make work on retail you must build the packaging project instead of the normal project
If you want to use with the sideloader you must build for the store then pull the msix out of the appxupload```
